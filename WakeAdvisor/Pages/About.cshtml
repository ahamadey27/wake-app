    <p>
        The Hudson River Southbound Freighter Wake Advisor is an ASP.NET Core web application designed to help users identify optimal times for wake surfing behind southbound freighters on the Hudson River near Kingston, NY. The app correlates low tide conditions (â‰¤ 2 feet) with predicted southbound freighter approaches using real-time and forecasted data from NOAA and AIS APIs.
